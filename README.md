# Virtual Tables
## Learn how to use virtual tables for metrics and configuration properties

Virtual tables, introduced in Apache CassandraÂ® 4.0, allow you to expose metrics and properties of the node with the same interface as ordinary tables. This enables a much easier way to observe the state and health of the cluster without leaving the CQL protocol.

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
* Explore virtual tables and their contents
* Learn what you _cannot_ do with virtual tables
* Understand what to expect if you change node settings

_This hands-on lab is available on our [https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4](https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandra._
